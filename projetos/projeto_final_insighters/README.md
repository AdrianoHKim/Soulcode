# **Final Project**

Welcome to the repository of the data analysis project "NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LANDSCAPE IN BRAZIL: RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES."

This repository contains some of the resources used to conduct data analysis on the proposed theme in the conclusion project of BOOTCAMP MARTECH SOULCODE ACADEMY - DATA ANALYST - AD2.

Technologies and tools such as Google Colab, Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Looker Studio, Power BI, MongoDB, Python Pandas, and PySpark were used to perform advanced analyses.

## Context
The energy produced in the national territory has hydroelectric power plants as its main source of generation.

However, in recent years, precisely from 2017, there has been a sharp growth in renewable energies. According to the queries made in the project, in public databases, whether governmental or private, part of the evolution of energy can be explained by the large expansion of solar energy generation and supply, which grew rapidly from 2017 onwards, accompanied by wind energy, albeit more discreetly.

Brazil is a country of continental dimensions and has extensive areas with long months of solar radiation coverage, such as the Southeast and Midwest and especially the Northeast region, where the largest amount of centralized solar energy generation plants and farms is concentrated. However, this is not the only source of solar energy generation. The long exposure to sunlight throughout the country, combined with innovative incentives and regulations favoring the use of renewable energies, especially photovoltaic solar energy, has allowed the installation of mini and micro solar energy generators, known as distributed generation.

Distributed generation, mainly resulting from surplus energy production and shared generation, has considerably increased the availability of energy in the distribution system year after year, reducing generation costs in the medium term since the necessary investments are spread over time.

Highlighting here, in addition to relieving the overload of the national energy matrix, the use of new technologies that require the use of electricity, such as charging points for hybrid and electric cars installed in various locations. Serving as a supplementary source of supply, these points help expand the local supply, close to charging points and/or high-demand consumers, consequently increasing the use of clean energy-based equipment and vehicles.
